  text: Let's build a **safer**, *healthier* theatre community for South Carolina
---

Following South Carolina Governor Henry McMasterâ€™s order reopening theatres and other venues, we penned [an open letter](/letter/) to the theatre community of South Carolina. We then hosted a [town hall to hear from experts](/news/checkin/) about the risks of producing live theatre in a pandemic. Now we are resolved to help each other build the safer, healthier theatre community we want to see in our state.

**We will return to the stage. When it is safe, and not a moment sooner.**
