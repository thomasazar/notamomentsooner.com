From Katherine Escobar: 

> You may know that I’m a huge supporter of Upstate Theatre. Since the theatres have been shut down, I have been **donating 20% of Escobar Photography gift card sales** to local theatres and school theatre programs. I allow the purchaser to designate the program, and so far many upstate programs have benefited including Greenville Theatre, SCCT, Mill Town Players, Centre Stage, Woodmont High, JL Mann, Fine Arts Center, SCGSAH.

> It would be great if more people knew about this opportunity to help out local theatres when updating their headshots ! 

> I really miss photographing local productions, and I hope it won’t be long before everyone can safely be back on stage.
