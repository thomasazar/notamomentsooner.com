While we may not be together this summer due to the postponement of the 2020 Festival Season to 2021, it doesn’t mean Glow will stop entertaining you. It does mean that we get a whole extra year to celebrate Glow's milestone 10th Anniversary Season.

Glow Lyric Theatre has created **Glow Online** so they can continue to provide the kind of experience you’ve come to expect from Glow: thoughtful, innovative and authentic, with a focus on fostering empathy and understanding. Join them for digital programming that offers an intimate view into the lives of the artists who make up Glow and celebrates our rich history as South Carolina’s only opera and musical theatre company.
