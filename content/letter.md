# To the Boards and Leadership of South Carolina Theatres —

Live theatre means sharing the human experience. It is gathering together in one place, at one time, to share the air and energy with audiences, performers, technicians, ushers, patrons — the entire walk of life. It bonds us through storytelling, a tradition as old as humanity itself.

Right now, we are in the grips of a global pandemic that touches every aspect of our lives. As much as we may want to believe otherwise, live theatre is no exception to this. Social distancing and masking are necessary. Gathering crowds in enclosed spaces is a danger. Speaking and singing, the very essence of performance, increases the risk of spreading the virus. These are the non-negotiable rules of the pandemic, and they are in direct conflict with the environment necessary to create live theatre.

Despite that risk, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has decided that, as of August 3, theatres can reopen at 50% capacity. In light of this governmental decision, we could no longer stay silent. The threat of this virus reaches into every venue, every seat, every stage. To combat this threat, and to protect the Upstate’s live theatre industry, we:

- Implore theatres to **stop attempting to produce live indoor performance events**;
- Encourage theatres to **seek out opportunities** for online performance and new play development activities;
- Advocate **creative solutions involving outdoor performance and rehearsals** while maintaining social distancing and requiring masks for actors, crew, and audiences;
- Invite area theatres to let us know how we can help **champion and support their organizations** without putting our bodies on the line;
- Suggest that **failure to adhere to health guidelines and best practices** almost guarantees a lengthier time of quarantine and possible second mandated lockdown; and
- Ensure theatres that **we will not accept live work in dangerous pandemic conditions**, until such time that a vaccine is widely available, and/or the load of new viral cases is significantly and sustainably lowered.

We fully support our area theatres as they innovate ways to safely return to the stage, but we also insist that *safer pandemic conditions* meet the following criteria: all actors are able to socially distance at all times both backstage and onstage, all production crew are masked and socially distanced at all times, and all audience members are masked and socially distanced from each other as well as the performers. If these criteria are not met, we can not and will not work.

As artists, when invited to perform our first instinct is typically to enthusiastically say *“Yes!”* In coming together as a collective in this moment, we the undersigned are stating as a coalition that we will say “No.” We sign this to inform you of our stance, but also to **hold one another accountable for the future health of theatre and ourselves**.

We want to come back to the stage, to the audience. But we will not risk our health and well-being in the long-term for the fleeting joy of performance in the short-term. This pandemic has left a hole in the community, but it also offers all of us an opportunity to reflect and design for the future. We encourage theatres to use this time to develop anti-racist practices and policies, explore opportunities for a diverse range of artistic voices, and offer virtual anti-racist training for area artists.

We miss you. When it is safe, we will return to you, healthy and ready to work and rebuild what has been damaged.

When it is safe, and not a moment sooner.
