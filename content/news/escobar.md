Katherine Escobar is a huge supporter of Upstate Theatre. Since the theatres have been shut down, she has been **donating 20% of Escobar Photography gift card sales** to local theatres and school theatre programs. The purchaser may choose to designate the program, and so far many upstate programs have benefited including Greenville Theatre, SCCT, Mill Town Players, Centre Stage, Woodmont High, JL Mann, Fine Arts Center, SCGSAH.

Take an opportunity to help out local theatres when updating your headshots!
