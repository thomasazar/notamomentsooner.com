Our 2020 Season may have been delayed to 2021, but we’re still celebrating the joy and excitement of opening night…

Even though we couldn’t open our productions this summer, this 45 minute virtual concert gives an elegant sneak peek into Glow’s thought-provoking next season.

Get swept away to Egypt, Italy, and the Mississippi River as six breathtaking singers perform songs from our upcoming 2021 season of *Aida the Musical*, *Showboat* and *Tosca*. Performers include L’Oréal Roaché as Aida, Ethan Rich as Radames, Lloyd Reshard Jr as Joe, Danielle Knox as Magnolia, Hugo Vera as Cavaradossi and Marina Harris as Tosca.

Selections include the powerful “Ol’ Man River” from *Showboat*, the rock anthem “Easy As Life” from *Aida* and one of the most famous opera arias of all time, “Vissi d’arte,” from *Tosca*, plus many more!

A Very Happy Unopening is FREE to watch with a suggested donation of $10 to help Glow reach a goal of $1,500. Proceeds go directly to support the needs of the 2021 Festival Season which include: artist & staff salaries and costumes, lighting, props and set construction.
