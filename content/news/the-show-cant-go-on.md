From the [*Post and Courier* article by Nathaniel Cary](https://www.postandcourier.com/greenville/business/the-show-cant-go-on-south-carolina-arts-community-faces-dire-financial-future/article_eac34996-f391-11ea-9089-cff272ac20d2.html):

> Across South Carolina stage lights are dark, orchestras and operas remain silent, and art museums maintain shells of normal operations.
>
> Coronavirus and the resulting shutdown of almost anything that draws a crowd has devastated the arts industry statewide. Venues large and small have been hit. Some may not recover. It may be a year or more before the curtain goes up on live theater. Those arts organizations that have reopened to a degree, like museums, see a fraction of normal visitors.
>
> Budgets sliced. Employees laid off. Projects delayed. Even with federal loans applied for and local grants granted, arts organizations are scrambling to hold on. 
>
> The state economy may well lose $1.2 billion this year that the arts normally contributes, a Brookings Institute report projects. When theaters or music venues are closed, local economies lose out on the synergy of diners, parking fees or shopping that foot traffic adds to towns large and small.
