# We're all in this together

Even though we are apart, we are not alone. Many organizations have responded to the need for education, assistance, and information. Here are a few resource hubs that are doing their part in helping us make it through together.

- [Metropolitan Arts Council](https://www.greenvillearts.com/)  
Arts organizations in the Upstate are hurting from the pandemic. If you can help, every donation makes a difference.

For individuals and organizations within the arts communities. This resource hub contains a wealth of information about relief funds, mental health, reopening guidance for each state, and much more.
